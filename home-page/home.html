     <p>This page is intended to be half informational and half passion project blog for me to show my adventures around the great state of Michigan catching many different fish species. While I mainly know about the Chinook Salmon, I have a strong interest towards other fish species in the salmonid family including Coho and Steelhead. The interest doesn't just lie within migratory salmonids though I love to catch many other species depending on what is seasonly available.  </p>
